Congratulations, you are now the lead investigator and administrator of your very own [Gatelight](http://www.discourse.org) investigation. :hatching_chick:

### Getting Started

If you haven't already, launch the [setup wizard](/wizard) and go through the steps to configure this site. You can run the wizard as many times as you want, it's completely safe!

### Admin Dashboard

Exercise your admin superpowers any time via the admin dashboard at

[**/admin**](/admin)

You can also access it via the "hamburger" <kbd>☰</kbd> menu in the upper right: Admin functions are generally marked with the wrench :wrench:  icon, so look for that.

### Admins, Moderators and Everyone Else

If you want, you can invite different levels of collaborators.

Admins (like you) and moderators have official functions administering this website.

1. **Admins** can do anything and configure anything on this site.
2. **Moderators** can edit all posts and users, but cannot add categories or change any site settings.

To add admins or moderators:

- have them sign up on the site (or [send out an invitation to join via your user page](/my/invited))
- click the admin button :wrench: on their user page
- look for the <kbd>Grant Admin</kbd> and <kbd>Grant Moderator</kbd> buttons there

### Categories

You have three default categories:

1. [Site Feedback](/category/site-feedback) – general discussion about the site itself. [It's important!](https://meta.discourse.org/t/5249)
2. [Lounge](/category/lounge) – a perk for users at trust level 3 and higher
3. [Staff](/category/staff) – visible only to staff (admins and moderators)

**Don't create too many initial categories**, as you can overwhelm your audience. You can always add more categories, and easily bulk recategorize topics later. It's better to figure out the organization as you go rather than assuming you'll get it all right from the beginning (hint: you won't).

To add a category, visit the [categories page](/categories), then click Create Category at the upper right. You can set security per-category so only certain groups of users can see topics in that category.

Every category has an initial "About this category" topic. This topic will be pinned to the top of the category, and the description you enter will be used in a bunch of places. Be sure to give your new category a good, clear description, so people understand what belongs there!

### Pinned Topics and Banners

Note that pinning topics does work a little differently in Gatelight:

- Once someone reads to the bottom of a pinned topic, it is automatically unpinned for them specifically. They can change this via the personal pin controls at the bottom of the topic.
- When staff pins a topic, they can pin it globally to all topic lists, or just within its category.

If a pin isn't visible enough, you can also turn one single topic into a **banner**. The banner topic floats on top of all topics and all primary pages. Users can permanently dismiss this floating banner by clicking the &times; in the upper right corner.

To make (or remove) a pin or a banner, use the admin wrench at the top right or bottom of the topic.

### The Trust System

For very large, public investigations - over five collaborators - Gatelight is designed to offer safe defaults for public investigations, even with no active moderation.

The [trust system](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) allows users to, over time, earn the trust of the community and gain abilities to assist in administering the investigation.

> **0 (new) &rarr; 1 (basic) &rarr; 2 (member) &rarr; 3 (regular) &rarr; 4 (leader)**

All new users start out in a sandbox with restrictions for everyone's safety. **Trust level 0 (new) users _cannot_** &hellip;

- post more than 2 hyperlinks
- post any images or file attachments
- send private messages
- flag posts or topics
- have actual links in the "about me" field of their profile
- @name mention more than 2 users in a post

Every action a user can take is rate limited for safety, and especially so for new users. But don't worry, new users can [transition to trust level 1](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) in about 10 minutes of reading.

Note that all new users will be granted trust level 1 until the investigation includes 50 collaborators.

### Sending Invitations

You can invite people to join your investigation via:

- The Invite button at the bottom of the topic.
- The Invite area on your profile page.

The invite area on your profile page also includes advanced Staff methods of [sending bulk invites](https://meta.discourse.org/t/sending-bulk-user-invites/16468), and [inviting users into groups](https://meta.discourse.org/t/invite-individual-users-to-a-group/15544).
